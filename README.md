# AirBnB_clone

<div align = "left">
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic.A database or files that store data (data = objects).
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).
 
We wonâ€™t build this application all at once, but step by step.
</div>

## The console:

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

    Create your data model
    Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
    Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

## Usage:

The command interpreter runs both in the interactive mode  and also  the non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

The interactive mode:

    $ ./console.py
    (hbnb) help

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
**Documented commands (type help <topic>):**
>>>>>>> da769404f09a9d798eee720bf1f1ac73d3b3c38f

    EOF  help  quit

<<<<<<< HEAD

## Documented commands (type help <topic>):

## Documented commands (type help <topic>):

    (hbnb) 
    (hbnb) 
    (hbnb) quit
    $
>>>>>>> da769404f09a9d798eee720bf1f1ac73d3b3c38f

### The non-interactive mode:

    $ echo "help" | ./console.py
    (hbnb)

**Documented commands (type help <topic>):**

    EOF  help  quit
    (hbnb) 
    $
    $ cat test_help
    help
    $
    $ cat test_help | ./console.py
    (hbnb)

**Documented commands (type help <topic>):**

    EOF  help  quit
    (hbnb) 
    $

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: 

    $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
